        <h1>Welcome to Pole Physics Game</h1>
        <p>
            Pole Physics is an exciting game that challenges your balancing skills. In this game, your goal is to balance a stick placed on a cart as long as possible. The longer you can keep the stick balanced, the higher your score will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll be controlling the cart, trying to keep the stick upright. Be careful, though, because the stick is affected by realistic physics, and it's not easy to keep it from falling over. As you play, you'll experience dynamic and animated effects that make the gameplay even more engaging.
